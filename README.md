## Overview
Maritime Trading Platform is a decentralized application built on the Stacks blockchain that revolutionizes ship-to-ship trading through smart contracts and GPS integration. The platform enables secure, automated maritime commerce with built-in regulatory compliance.

## Key Features
- Decentralized vessel registration and verification
- Smart contract-based trade agreements
- GPS-linked location verification
- Automated customs compliance
- Secure cargo tracking and transfer
- Real-time position monitoring
- Regulatory checkpoint automation

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
1. **Vessel Registry Contract**
   - Manages vessel registration and ownership
   - Stores vessel details and credentials
   - Handles ownership transfers

2. **Trade Agreement Contract**
   - Facilitates trade creation and execution
   - Manages escrow for secure transactions
   - Enforces location-based trade completion

3. **GPS Oracle Contract** (Coming Soon)
   - Verifies vessel locations
   - Implements geofencing for trade zones
   - Handles distance calculations

4. **Customs Compliance Contract** (Coming Soon)
   - Automates regulatory checkpoints
   - Manages document verification
   - Ensures compliance with maritime laws

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Frontend**: React.js (Coming Soon)
- **Backend Services**: Node.js (Coming Soon)
- **Location Services**: GPS Oracle Integration (Coming Soon)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks CLI
- Node.js and npm
- Clarity CLI
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wynaajike/maritimeSTXtrade.git
cd maritimeSTXtrade
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Smart Contract Interaction

### Vessel Registration
```clarity
(contract-call? .Maritime-Trading register-vessel 
    "vessel-id" 
    "registration-number" 
    "vessel-type" 
    u1000)
```

### Create Trade Agreement
```clarity
(contract-call? .Maritime-Trading create-trade-agreement 
    "trade-id" 
    'buyer-address 
    "cargo-type" 
    u100 
    u1000000 
    i40000000 
    i50000000)
```
